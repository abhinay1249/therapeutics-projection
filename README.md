## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales data of therapeutics. The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends.
- Grouping and summarizing sales by month and year.
- Visualizing top-selling medicines for each month.

## Features 

- #### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
   
  ◦ Handling missing values.  
  ◦ Dropping unnecessary columns.  
  ◦ Converting dates to appropriate datetime formats.

- #### Exploratory Data Analysis:
    
  ◦ Visualization of null values using heatmaps.  
  ◦ Understanding sales trends over time.
  
- #### Sales Insights:
    
  ◦ Identification of top-selling products by month and year.  
  ◦ Grouped analysis of sales data.

- #### Data Visualization:
    
  ◦ Graphical representation of sales trends and top-selling items.  
## Dataset
The dataset consists of therapeutic sales data with the following columns:

- SALE_INVOICE_NO, ITEM_NAME, ITEM_CODE, ITEM_BATCH, ITEM_SALE_PRICE, QTY_IN_UNITS, TOTAL_COST, INVOICE_DATE, and more.
- Includes sales, inventory, and transactional details.
 
## Workflow
The notebook follows a systematic workflow:

1. Import Libraries: Load essential Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2. Load Data: Read the dataset from an Excel file.
3. Data Cleaning:
   ◦ Drop unnecessary columns.
   ◦ Handle missing values.
   ◦ Convert date columns to proper datetime formats.
4. EDA:
   ◦ Check and visualize null values.
   ◦ Summarize data using value_counts and group by operations.
5. Data Transformation:
   ◦ Extract year and month from dates.
   ◦ Aggregate sales data by grouping.
6. Visualization:
   ◦ Plot trends for top-selling items by month and year.
